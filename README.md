Under certain conditions, the largest eigenvalue of a sample covariance matrix undergoes a well-known phase transition when the sample size n and data dimension p diverge proportionally. In the subcritical regime, this eigenvalue has fluctuations of order $n^{-2/3}$ that can be approximated by a Tracy-Widom distribution, while in the supercritical regime, it has fluctuations of order $n^{-1/2}$ that can be approximated with a Gaussian distribution. However, the statistical problem of determining which regime underlies a given dataset is far from resolved. We develop a new testing framework and procedure to address this problem. In particular, we demonstrate that the procedure has an asymptotically controlled level, and that it is power consistent for certain alternatives. Also, this testing procedure enables the design a new bootstrap method for approximating the distributions of functionals of the leading sample eigenvalues within the subcritical regime -- which is the first such method that is supported by theoretical guarantees.
